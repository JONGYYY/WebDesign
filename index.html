    <h1>Artist Profile</h1>
    <p2>Hi my name is Jonathan, but I like to go by Johnny. I grew up interested in many things like art, and although art was always just a hobby for me, a place where I could draw anything I wanted, how I wanted.  I feel that artists are meant to depict the world they perceive, adding their unique interpretation whether it is stylistic, choice of color or subject matter.
    </p2>
    <p2>
    I have selected works that I feel best represent myself - I like to capture moments in nature, like landscapes and seascapes. It makes me feel as if I'm part of another world or experiencing vivid memories of a place I've never been to. Throughout these selected pieces, I intended the central theme to be little moments that characterize how beautiful nature can be.
